# Climate Data Evaluation Tool

## Introduction

Welcome to the Climate Data Evaluation Tool repository! This tool is designed to facilitate the evaluation of climate model simulations and reanalysis data, allowing users to compare and analyze observed and simulated climate data. The tool provides various metrics, graphs, and visualizations to assess the performance of climate models.

## Features.

- Data Import: Easily import observation and simulation data for analysis.
- Data Validation: Validate data for consistency and completeness.
- Metric Calculation: Calculate metrics like RMSE, bias, correlation, and more.
- Seasonal Comparison: Visualize seasonal variations through graphs.
- Quantile-Quantile Analysis: Compare distributions using QQ plots.
- Taylor Diagrams: Assess model performance with Taylor diagrams.
- PDF Report Generation: Generate detailed PDF reports with results and graphs.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests, please open an issue on this repository.

## Note
you can find in the repository 2 files (simulation and observation) to try the tool
